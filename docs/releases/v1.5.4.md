# v1.5.4 Florence

Released: 2025-12-28

## Summary

Bug fixes for remote access, improving compatibility with different SSH environments.

## Bug Fixes

- **Login shell for remote commands**: Remote commands now run in `bash -l` to source login environment, fixing PATH issues where tools like `claude` are installed in `~/.local/bin`

- **Passwordless SSH detection**: Clear error message when SSH keys aren't configured, with setup instructions

- **`--port` controls dashboard port**: The `--port` flag now correctly sets the dashboard port (not just architect terminal), fixing port mismatches between local and remote configs

- **Version mismatch warnings**: Warns when remote CLI versions don't match local installation

## Migration Notes

None required. These are backwards-compatible bug fixes.
