## Dead Code Identified

| File | Item | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| `packages/codev/src/agent-farm/hq-connector.ts:429` | `stopHQConnector()` | Exported but never imported anywhere. `initHQConnector()` and `isHQEnabled()` are used. |

## Unused Dependencies

| Package | Location | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| `http-proxy` | packages/codev/package.json (dependency) | Zero imports in src/. Was likely used by old dashboard proxy, replaced by tower. |
| `@types/http-proxy` | packages/codev/package.json (devDependency) | Types for unused http-proxy. |
| `qrcode-terminal` | packages/codev/package.json (dependency) | Zero imports in src/. QR functionality may have been descoped or reimplemented. |
| `@types/qrcode-terminal` | packages/codev/package.json (devDependency) | Types for unused qrcode-terminal. |

## Stale Documentation

| Document | Issue |
|----------|-------|
| `codev/resources/arch.md` ~line 537, 981 | Directory structure diagram still shows `dashboard-server.ts` which was deleted in Spec 0090 Phase 4. The prose sections correctly note it was removed, but the tree diagram is stale. |

## Recommended Actions

1. Remove `http-proxy`, `@types/http-proxy`, `qrcode-terminal`, `@types/qrcode-terminal` from package.json
2. Remove or unexport `stopHQConnector()` from hq-connector.ts
3. Update arch.md directory tree diagram to remove `dashboard-server.ts` reference
