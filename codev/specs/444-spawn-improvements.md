# Spec 444: af spawn Improvements

## Status: stub

Stub spec for the builder to flesh out. See GitHub Issue #444.

## Summary

Two improvements to `af spawn`:

1. **Remove spec-file requirement** for protocols with a Specify phase (SPIR, ASPIR). Builder can create the spec itself.
2. **Use GitHub issue title** for SPIR/ASPIR project naming instead of deriving from spec filename.
