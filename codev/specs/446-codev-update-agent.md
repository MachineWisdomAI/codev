# Spec 446: codev update --agent

## Status: stub

Stub spec for the builder to flesh out. See GitHub Issue #446.

## Summary

Add a `--agent` flag to `codev update` that produces agent-friendly output instead of the interactive alignment flow. Should be representable as a skill with instructions for the agent to merge updated files and commit/push.
