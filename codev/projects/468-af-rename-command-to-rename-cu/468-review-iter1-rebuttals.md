# Review Rebuttal — Iteration 1

## Codex REQUEST_CHANGES

### 1. "af rename breaks after Tower restart"
**Status: REBUTTED (no change needed)**

Codex claims that after Tower restart, `shellperSessionId` is set to the old PTY id instead of the original shellper session id, causing 404 on rename.

This is incorrect. The reconnection logic at `tower-terminals.ts:545` uses:
```typescript
const shellperSessId = extractShellperSessionId(dbSession.shellper_socket) ?? dbSession.id;
```

`extractShellperSessionId` extracts the UUID from the socket path (`shellper-<UUID>.sock`). This UUID is the SAME `crypto.randomUUID()` that was injected as `SHELLPER_SESSION_ID` into the shell environment at creation (`tower-routes.ts:1434-1439`). The fallback to `dbSession.id` only fires if the socket path doesn't match the expected format, which doesn't happen for shellper-managed sessions.

The rename handler's two-step lookup (`tower-routes.ts`) first checks by PtySession ID, then scans by `shellperSessionId`. After reconnection, the PtySession has a new ID but its `shellperSessionId` correctly matches the env var in the running shell. Rename works after restart.

Gemini and Claude both approved without raising this concern.

### 2. "Stable ID lookup is not using SQLite"
**Status: REBUTTED (no change needed)**

The spec says the API should resolve sessions by stable ID. The implementation does this via PtySession in-memory scan of `shellperSessionId`, which IS the stable ID extracted from the socket path. Using SQLite for the lookup is unnecessary — PtySession objects already hold the stable ID after reconnection, and the rename handler needs a live PtySession reference anyway to update `session.label` in memory.

### 3. Contract-style tests
**Status: ACKNOWLEDGED (no change)**

Same concern raised and addressed in Phase 1-3 rebuttals. Contract-level tests verify the logic pieces; production code paths require a running Tower instance with PTY sessions. Combined with Phase 2's 23 handler-level tests, coverage is pragmatic. Gemini and Claude both approved the test approach.
